# Thermo-Informatic Gravital Instability Theory (TIGIT)-black-hole-information-transition
Conceptual notes and public timeline for the Thermo-Informatic Gravital Instability Theory (TIGIT) framework.
## Scope
This repository provides a public, timestamped conceptual outline and development timeline 
for the TIGIT framework related to black hole information transition.
Detailed derivations, full mathematical formulations, and experimental implications 
are intentionally omitted and are reserved for formal academic submission.
## Timeline
